## Abstract

This paper introduces the novel philosophical framework of ‘epistemic transposition’, arguing that fiduciary and ethical duties traditionally viewed as purely moral obligations are fundamentally epistemic, grounded in epistemic humility. By reframing fiduciary duties such as openness, honesty, and loyalty as inherently epistemic responsibilities toward knowledge, the paper significantly advances fiduciary theory and epistemic virtue ethics. It positions epistemic humility as a foundational normative virtue essential to fiduciary accountability and institutional governance, thus redefining how fiduciary obligations and ethical responsibilities are understood and operationalised. This reconceptualisation contributes a groundbreaking theoretical integration, reshaping philosophical discourses around epistemic responsibility, fiduciary openness, and institutional accountability.
